- My game fits the chosen genre because it is a storymode game, with different kinds of levels and challenges

Environment:  
Silver’s world, Soleanna, is a society 200 years into the future, where technology is far advanced past our own time. The people there are all human, just like Earth. It is riddled with huge cities, vast biomes, great oceans, and endless wonders. It is like our planet in terms of position and orbit, has a healthy, breathable atmosphere, and is around the same size as Earth.

Background:  
Silver the hedgehog was born with his psychokinetic powers by the power of the Master Emerald (all the Chaos Emeralds combined into one source). This was done by the rulers of his world to create an ultimate protector for their planet. After his creation, the Emeralds were hidden away. One day he experiences a vision about the end of his world due to an apocalypse caused by Iblis, an entity called the Flames of Disaster. He fears that this will come true, and, with the help of his friend Blaze, seeks out the Chaos Emeralds, spread throughout the planet, to gain the power to save his world before his vision comes true.

Characters: Silver the hedgehog \- the ultimate protector of Soleanna, and the game’s main character | Blaze the cat \- Silver’s best friend (and maybe his crush), she helps him find the Chaos Emeralds, and was also created by the Master Emerald’s power as a fail-safe in the event that Iblis is released, she is even a playable character as well | Elise \- the daughter of Cael, princess to the empire, and secretly holds Iblis within her, and if she cries it is released (little does Silver know) | Cael \- the sole ruler of Soleanna, father of Elise, the main person responsible for creating Silver and Blaze then the hiding of the Emeralds, he tries to stop Silver from retrieving them because he knows Iblis is inside Elise and doesn’t want her to get hurt

- The target audience for this game is all Sonic lovers out there that would really enjoy the unique theme of an “unhappy ending” no matter what, and the general backstory of one of the most popular characters in the entire saga, and it is appropriate for all ages. Player motivations include gaining and maxing out amazing abilities for both playable characters, defeating bosses, exploring the game world, and playing through a fairly lengthy storymode.  
- My game is unique because it incorporates a unique story ending, tells a never-before told origin story of the mysterious character Silver, introduces new characters, also sheds light on Blaze’s origin, and so much more  
- A few games that I really like and are similar to my idea are Sonic Frontiers for great exploration experience, Sonic x Shadow Generations for also incorporating a character’s origin story, and Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles for an accurate and elaborate storyline.  
- One game that would be my idea’s primary competition would probably be Sonic x Shadow Generations, because it also tells an origin story, that of Shadow the hedgehog. I think my idea is definitely more unique, however, because it includes not one, but two origin stories, and an unhappy ending is inevitable.  
    
  I hope that everyone that plays my game will have an awesome time throughout the entire story, while being challenged a fair amount to make the game worth playing. In the end, I would hope that questions leaving us in wonder of Silver and Blaze’s true origins are answered as accurately as possible. This game has a lot of plot twists, so the fact that it’s hard to be predictable makes it a must-play.
